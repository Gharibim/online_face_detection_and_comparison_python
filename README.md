# online_face_detection_and_comparison_python

In this project, I am using OpenCV in Python to start a video then detect faces and draw a square around the face.[Click here to see the same project using Opencv in Python.](https://github.com/Gharibim/online_face_detection_and_comparison)

<img src="monitor-0.png" width=500>
Add and remove different face cascades for differece results

<img src="monitor-1.png" width=500>

The only recognized face is my face is (image: me.jpg). You can simply add your image instead, then change the code print your name.
